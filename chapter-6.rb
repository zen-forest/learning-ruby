# Classes
# A class is a collection of methods and data that are used as a blueprint to create multiple objects relating to that class. 

# Objects
# An object is a single instance of a class. An object of class Person is a single person. An object of Dog is a single dog. If you think of 
# objects as real-life objects, a class is the classification, whereas the object is the actual object or "thing" itself.
