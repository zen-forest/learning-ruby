# Learning Ruby

I've been studying the book [Beginning Ruby 3: from beginner to pro](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ruby-3-Beginner-Pro/dp/1484263235) and this repo contains my notes. 

Unlike past experiences when learning to program where I was advised to start a project, I'm doing the opposite and focusing on syntax. This has been by far more successful for me personally. 

## My setup 
IRB in one window | VSCode in the left | GIT for tracking progress | Profit.
